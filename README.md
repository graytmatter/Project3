Project3: Assign-Monitor
========================

This is a Google docs tracker writen in Node.js and optemised for Ipad usage.

During high school one of the things that most annoyed me was the way that teachers posted their homework online. Each Teacher had their own website, or google Doc, or evrenote, or whatever, which you would have to navigate to each afternoon. Often I would assume that I didn't have homework or just forget to check. This led to many a nasty suprise the next day.

For this project I wanted to build something that would make this easier. As I saw it there were two options, one build something for the teachers, where they would post the hw, and the software would be in charge of getting it out to students. Or I could build something for the students where they would input the classes they were taking and the software would take care of getting them the information they needed. While the first option would be really nice, it would only be effective if all the teachers adopted it. And that would only really happen if the adminstration demmanded it. I feel that it's easier to have a student focused product, the teachers are by and large happy with their system, they and the admistration have other things to do.

During my first iteration I built I site that would keep track of google documents and would inform you if any of your documents had updated that day and if so would provide you with a link to the page. It had a janky UI, and once you added a course it was permanent.

For my second iteration I revamped the UI, imbeded the google docs in Iframes, and allowed you to delete classes you were no longer taking.
